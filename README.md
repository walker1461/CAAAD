# Catawba Area Agency on Aging Database

This project was created during my senior year at Winthrop University in Software Development I and Software Development II.  We were divided into groups of 5 and were introduced to clients in the local area for whom we would developing a free software in order to help them achieve their goals.  Our client was the Catawba Area Agency on Aging, and they requested that we construct a database for them to keep track of their clients and the associated information.  Throughout the two semesters we planned and developed this software using the agile methodology, while creating extensive documentation of the program and our progress.  We decided to approach the project using C# .NET and MySQL in Visual Studio.  This project taught me a lot about what it is like to be a part of a team creating a full piece of software from start to finish, as well as communicating with a client and writing technical documentation.  The included documents give an in-depth look at the systems we built.
